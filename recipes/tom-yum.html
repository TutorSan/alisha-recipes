    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tom Yum soup – everybody’s favourite Thai soup is finally here! Choose from the classic clear Tom Yum Goong, or make the creamy 
        Tom Yum version – both are made with the same broth. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Medium to large shrimp</li>
        <li>Chili</li>
       <li>Galangal</li>
        <li>Kaffir Lime Leaves</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lemongrass</li>
        <li>Fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Oyster mushrooms</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the shrimp stock by sauteing shrimp shells and/or heads until the bottom of the pot starts collecting browned bits. You can add some chopped onions to this step, if desired.</li>
        <li>If using shrimp heads, use tongs to squeeze out the tasty tomalley inside. </li>
        <li>Simmer for about 5 minutes and strain. (Note that in the video I used to simmer the shrimp stock for 45 minutes, but I have since learned that that is not necessary and the shrimp flavour is actually stronger with only 5 minutes of simmering.) </li>
        <li>Strain the stock and add the lemongrass, galangal, makrut lime leaves and Thai chilies. </li>
        <li>Simmer for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Add the shrimp, bring the stock back to a simmer and then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Allow the residual heat of the soup to fully cook the shrimp for the next 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Thai chili paste and fish sauce and stir to dissolve the chili paste.</li>
        <li>Add lime juice and then taste and adjust, adding the sugar only if needed. </li>
        <li>It's ready to serve! Note: the herbs are for infusion purposes only and are not meant to be eaten; however, they're traditionally left in the soup for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
